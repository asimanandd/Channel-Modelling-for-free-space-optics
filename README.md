# Channel-Modelling-for-free-space-optics

This project review explores the Free Space Optics (FSO) which is a
developing technology for Line-of-Sight communication that uses light propagation
in free space that provides various advantages like high bandwidth, high data rate,
ease of installation, free licensing and secure communication. But the diverse effects
like attenuation on FSO communication link due to environmental factors and
weather conditions like fog, rain, dust, sand storms, clouds, temperature, scintillation
loss which is a function of atmospheric turbulence and the other factors like range,
effects of physical obstructions are an essential topic for study which is discussed in
this paper. We have done the simulation on the FSO communication link in Opti
system software.
